## Contributions
* **Prompts:** For a flawless user experience, provided the user with a series of prompts for password criteria. The initial prompt gives the user the opportunity to enter a valid numeric number in the case of a typing error. 
* **Validation:** Validated user input to ensure the user has chosen at least one of the four different character types to be included in the password.
